5. **Test thoroughly**: Try with multiple topics
6. **Document changes**: Explain why prompts were changed

### Example Prompt Improvement

prompt = """Create a social story about going to the dentist.

Requirements:
- 5-6 pages
- Include main character, parent, dentist

- End with positive outcome

Output as JSON with structure: {...}
"""
