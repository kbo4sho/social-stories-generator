        After playing for a while, the family sits on a bench to have a snack. 
        Alex drinks some water and eats an apple. Alex made a new friend at the playground!
        They played together on the slide and laughed a lot. It was a wonderful day at the park.
        When it's time to go home, Alex waves goodbye to the new friend and says, 
        "I hope to see you at the park again!"

        <strong>Teaching Point:</strong> Going to the park can be a great way to exercise, 
        have fun, and make new friends. It's important to rest and drink water when playing outside.
